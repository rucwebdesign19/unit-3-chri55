        Nintendo Lowers Egg Spawning Rates in April's Bunny Day Event
      </h2>
      <p class="posted-at">April 6, 2020</p>
      <p class="article-main">Nintendo released an update for the game today, April 6th 2020 which changed the spawning frequency of some of the eggs. Players have been seeing less of the balloons containing Sky Eggs, but reportedly around the same amount of Water Eggs as before, leading the community to think that only the Sky Eggs spawn rates have been altered. Players have also found that the number of trees containing Leaf eggs in their town each day has remained the same, as well as the number of buried Earth Eggs. This change comes as welcome to most players, who were making it known on social media that the eggs were interefering with normal gameplay: getting in the way of regular balloons spawning, taking spots in the river where rare fish could spawn, and overall permeating into their day on their island too much. Players have also reportedly been finding more cherry blossom-related DIY recipes as a result of this change, much to their delight. The Cherry Blossom festival currently running for April features some lovely new furniture players can craft.</p>

      <h2 class="article-title">Bunny Day Event Begins! April 1-12th Is An Egg Collectathon</h2>
      <p class="posted-at">April 1, 2020</p>
      <p class="article-main">The Bunny Day event has begun in Animal Crossing: New Horizons! When players log on for the first time this month, they will be greeted by the event's mascot, Zipper T. Bunny, hiding eggs in their town. He will tell the player that he has hidden eggs and Bunny Day themed DIY recipes throughout the town for them to find, until April 12th. He says that he will return on Sunday, April 12th to see the player's progress, and that if they have crafted ALL of the special recipes they will be rewarded with a "super special, awesome surprise!" Eggs to create these recipes, as well as the recipes themselves can appear from balloons, chopping trees, hitting rocks, digging them up from marked spots, fall off trees similar to fruit, and from fishing them up. Villagers have also been noted as saying that more eggs will be appearing on Nook Miles Ticket Mystery Islands. </p>

        Players Discover "Tarantula Island" Exploit on Nook Mystery Islands
      </h2>
      <p class="posted-at">March 31, 2020</p>
      <p class="article-main">A Tweet has been circulating through the Animal Crossing community lately, detailing how to get tarantulas to appear on Nook Miles Ticket Mystery Islands. Taratulas are a very high-value target when arriving on these islands, worth 9,000 bells when sold. So, when a player detailed how to make lots of tarantulas appear on Mystery Islands, others began trying the method and confirming its success. The method can only be done at night (later than 7pm) and involves clearing all trees from the island as well as their stumps, picking all flowers, and destroying all rocks. For the method to work, the only thing that must remain on the grass part of the island are weeds and flower stems. Everything else can be thrown on the beach, and nothing on the beach has any effect on making taratulas appear. If the player begins to scare away all non-tarantula bugs that spawn on the island like wharf roaches and beetles, they will begin to see tarantulas spawn.</p>
